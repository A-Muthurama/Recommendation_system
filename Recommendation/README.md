# Recommendation_system
The Movie Recommendation System is a Flask-based web application that provides personalized movie recommendations. It uses a content-based recommendation approach, leveraging the genre of movies to find and suggest similar ones. Users can input a movieId to get recommendations of similar movies based on their preferences.
